## priority queue
https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dheroy/4331code/book/doc/java/util/PriorityQueue.html 
#### priority queue orders elements according to an order specified at construction time, which is specified either according to their natural order (see Comparable), or according to a java.util.Comparator, depending on which constructor is used. A priority queue does not permit null elements. A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in ClassCastException).
#### A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal capacity governing the size of an array used to store the elements on the queue. It is always at least as large as the queue size. As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified.
