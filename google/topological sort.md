### Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.It is a linear ordering of vertices for DAG.
There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. 
### The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no in-coming edges).
