on-site 问题：
1） 给一个数据，做一些data science preprocessing. 然后预测一个target column.
2) talk about your research and interesting projects
3) A. why ericsson. B what you see yourself after 5 years in Ericsson. C. how to approach difficult problems.
onsite主要是是数据分析和建模，第二轮是research , and interesting projects you have done.  第三轮是behavior questions. 就是很常见的那种。只是稍微提到了一点CNN， 还有如何知道CNN是不是正常工作，像overfit, 这种问题。

machine learning theory:
1 what is the linear regression assumption? 
2 for both linear regression and logistic regression, for categorical variable, we should use pd.get_dummies(drop_first=True) to tranform the data. for numerial data, we should do missing data imputation. and then nomalize/scaling the data. 
3 inference the maxmum likelihood of logistic regression and its loss fuction. 
4 what does the hyper parameter mean for SVM. like C, gamma, kernal?
5 method for dimension reduction, explain what is PCA
6 what is the metrics for classification and regression?

application:
1 when the data sets is imbalanced, and the data is numerical, how can we balance it.  how can we generate more sample from minority numerical classes. 
2 like binary classification, like credict card fake detection, if we take care one pariticular class mislabel, how can we deal with this situation?
7 what does it mean tf and idf? how to feed data into word2vec to get vector representation? 

project: 
what is formula to detect fake followers to improve domain expert recommendation
what is the challenge for web user classification? 

programming: 
climb staris programming
