## Tell me about yourself 
I am a data scientist(data science engineer) with hands-on experience focusing on machine learning application on the big data. My educational background is computer science. Currently I have been working at Cisco and before coming to the US I  have worked for some leading Internet companies in China. I have designed and developed some AI projects like web user classification system, social media analytics and recommendation system on various domains like news articles, music etc.  Most of the time I worked as a hybrid role in both data science research and engineer development to build a machine learning pipeline. I am strong working independently because I was often the only data scientist on my team, yet love working with others being a team player like collaborating with other engineers or product managers.
