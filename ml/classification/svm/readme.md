sklearn
* c 
c controls the misclassifciation on training data. 
large c give you low bias and hig variance 
low bias because you penalize the cost of misclassification a lot, while small c value, does not penalize the cost too much, so it gives 
high bias and low variance. so that has to do with that bias variance tradeoff. 
* gamma
small gamma means Gaussian for large variance. large gamma means the variance is small 
a large gamma lead to high bias and low variance in the model.
