 In Bagging, each individual trees are independent of each other because they consider different subset of features and samples.
 In boosting tree individual weak learners are not independent of each other because each tree correct the results of previous tree. Bagging and boosting both can be consider as improving the base learners results.
 Both random Forest and Gradient Boosting ensemble methods are be used for classification as well as regression task.
 In random forest, Individual tree is built on a subset of the features and individual tree is built on a subset of observations
 max_depth is a hyperparameter in Gradient Boosting: Lower is better parameter in case of same validation accuracy; Increase the value of max_depth may overfit the data
